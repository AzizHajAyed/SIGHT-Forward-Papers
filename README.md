This repository is composed of 3 parts : 
- Water generation unit folder : Contains all the files/ research papers applied and used for the water generation Unit.
	Atmospheric-Water-Generator-1: The Atmospheric Water Generator extracts water vapor from air, purifying it for clean drinking water. It operates like a refrigerator, condensing vapor through compression. Aimed at water-scarce regions, it prioritizes energy versatility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Challenges in water output were addressed by optimizing system efficiency and increasing condensation area using a high-conductivity copper plate. These innovations tackle water scarcity by harvesting atmospheric water.
	The Vapor Compression Refrigeration Cycle:The Vapor Compression Refrigeration Cycle chills using a compressor, condenser, valve, and evaporator. A small-scale prototype efficiently produces daily water in diverse humidities, especially in 35Â°C+ temperatures and over 50% humidity. It's scalable, has a secure material supply, and a filed patent, promising for homes or businesses. Calculations determine condensation points in varying conditions.
	Calculations:calculations on the humidity on any given atmospheric pressure 
	Providing-AWG-in-buildings:The building integrates Atmospheric Water Generators (AWGs) on upper floors, tapping into higher humidity levels to provide filtered water stored above ground. Gravity-fed faucets ensure 24/7 community access, while the ground floor serves as a market for tower-grown produce. Leveraging humidity, AWGs generate water, mirroring ancient Incan dew collection and modern fog-catching techniques. Using refrigeration-based systems, condensed water undergoes purification before storage. Costs, around $5000 per AWG, are offset via potential donations, UN loans, and adaptable construction. This 'urban acupuncture' model prioritizes flexible, accessible water solutions for communities facing scarcity.

- Hydrogen generation unit folder : Contains all the files/ research papers applied and used for the Hydrogen generation Unit.
	prototypeElectrolysis: The educational prototype includes an electrolyzer, fuel cells, and experiments showcasing electrolysis principles, Faraday's laws, and fuel cell characteristics. Demonstrating hydrogen and oxygen production, it reveals the electrolyzer's threshold voltage (1.4 V) and maximum power (3.8W). The experiments explore single and connected fuel cell characteristics, revealing voltage and power variations in serial and parallel connections. Serial connections maintain power, while parallel connections manage increasing load currents. The parallel setup achieves higher currents, aiming to keep voltage stable. These findings offer insights into fuel cell efficiencies and applications in various load scenarios, enriching understanding of electrolysis and fuel cell behavior.
	Hydrogen Storage & Distribution:Mitigating risks in hydrogen storage and distribution involves thorough risk assessments, strict safety standards, R&D for improved technology, resilient infrastructure design, regulatory compliance, public awareness campaigns, comprehensive emergency response plans, stakeholder collaboration, and real-time facility monitoring. Contingency plans are crucial, outlining specific steps in case of an incident. Proactive measures aim to address safety, technological advancement, regulatory adherence, and public perception, ensuring a comprehensive risk management strategy for successful deployment and adoption of hydrogen technologies.
	Optimized Photovoltaic Hydrogen Generation :Ahmad and El Shenawy from Egypt conducted experiments integrating photovoltaic modules with hydrogen electrolyzers for hydrogen production. They tested direct coupling and coupling with a maximum power point tracker (MPPT). MPPT optimized the system, increasing hydrogen production and overall efficiency despite slightly decreased electrolyzer efficiency due to higher temperature and Ohmic losses. The system's efficiency was affected by environmental factors like solar intensity and temperature.
	Solar-Panel-Splits-Water-to-Produce-Hydrogen (1):Belgian researchers at KU Leuven created a solar panel that splits water vapor in the air into hydrogen using sunlight, potentially enabling homes to generate emissions-free hydrogen for heating. The technology, which converts 15% of solar energy into hydrogen, promises a breakthrough in clean hydrogen production. Details remain confidential due to intellectual property concerns, but the team aims to test it in a rural Belgian town. In Australia, scientists developed a device generating high-purity hydrogen from air moisture, promising up to 93 liters of hydrogen per square meter hourly, potentially replacing natural gas in households. These innovations offer cleaner energy alternatives, albeit still in early development. 
	Photovoltaic Hydrogen Generation :In 2008, Helmut Tributsch from the Hahn-Meitner-Institut highlighted the challenges and potential of photovoltaic hydrogen generation. He discussed the fundamental process of converting light into hydrogen and the importance of efficient solar energy conversion. Tributsch emphasized the limitations posed by high costs of photovoltaic electricity for hydrogen production. He explained the thermodynamic constraints and the efficiencies required for successful water splitting. While acknowledging the potential of solar hydrogen, he stressed the need to address technological challenges to make it a large-scale, cost-effective solution for sustainable energy.
